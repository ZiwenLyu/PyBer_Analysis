# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis
PyBer is a virtual ridesharing company. This project is to help PyBer analyze and visualize ridesharing data of 120 cities, exploring relations between type of cities, total fare, total drivers, total rides, fare per ride, and fare per driver from Jan, 2019 to May, 2019. In PyBer_Challenge, I will use Python to clean and derive necessary data in a new form, and create a multiple-line graph that showcases the total weekly fares for each city type. This analysis will help PyBer to know about ridesharing accessibility and decide the affordability for underserved neighborhoods.

## Results: 
This is the PyBer summary for each city type.

This is the PyBer total weekly fares for each city type from Jan 2019 to May 2019.

From the figure we can clearly see, urban cities have the most amount of ridesharing fares, suburban cities are the second most, and rural cities have the least amount of ride fares. This is because urban cities have more drivers and rides than two other city types, and consequently urban cities have the least fare per ride and fare per driver while rural cities have the highest fare per ride and suburban cities have the highest fare per driver. The ride fare level for each city type basically remain the same from Jan to May, and in the early February there's a little rise for every city type. 

## Summary: 
To address disparities among the city types, it is recommended:
- to allocaote some urban cities' drivers to / increase drivers in rural cities.
- to allocaote some urban cities' drivers to / increase drivers in suburban cities.
- to moderately decrease the drive fare in suburban and rural cities.
